# gmodmmo
An "mmo" gamemode for Garry's Mod.
No, this isn't a true "mmo engine" for Garry's Mod, however, the title of
rpg has been augmented by other instances of Gmod RP, such as DarkRP.
This is intended to be a basis for RPGs, as opposed to gamemodes that allow RP.

Think more Elder Scrolls rather than StarWarsRP.
